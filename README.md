## KotlinWebApp

Template for writing a web app with Kotlin. Since Kotlin compiles to both JVM code and JavaScript,
why use anything else? ðŸ˜‚

### Backend

The backend is set up for using the [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor) framework,
a powerful Kotlin library for creating servers.

### Frontend

The frontend is configured for using 
[Kotlin React](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-react), a dsl
for writing React code using Kotlin lambdas. It also has a [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) 
compiler set up for styling.
